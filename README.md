# Android-App93
GenAI was used often during this project. What I did was I would prompt genAI with the first feature I wanted it to build and how I wanted it to look. After it produces the code I would test it and then reprompt if it didn't function correctly/the way I wanted it to. I did little to no manual implementation and didn't have to scrape through the android documentation.
