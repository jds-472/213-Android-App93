# Android-App93
GenAI was used often during this project. What I did was I would prompt GenAI with the first feature I wanted it to build and how I wanted it to look. After it produces the code I would test it and then reprompt if it didn't function correctly/the way I wanted it to. I did little to no manual implementation and didn't have to scrape through the android documentation.

One example of GenAI use for this project would be asking ChatGPT to "add conjunction and disjunction to searching." Then, I would test the given code for any errors. Oftentimes, I would recognize the issue at hand and reprompt ChatGPT to fix the bug. Another way GenAI was used was to check for any required functionality that was still missing and get a summary of the steps towards implementing said function. This way, we could determine the best prompts per step to ask in order to ensure correct implementation.
